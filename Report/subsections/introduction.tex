\section{Introduction}
This project demonstrates machine learning techniques using scikit-learn~\cite{sklearn_linear_model,sklearn_pca} 
and evaluates model performance using standard metrics such as mean squared error~\cite{wiki_mse} 
and coefficient of determination (RÂ²)~\cite{wiki_r_squared}. The analysis follows established 
machine learning practices. For the more complex dataset of the Red Wine Quality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)~\cite{wiki_pca, sklearn_pca}
was applied for dimensionality reduction to determine the most significant features. Data handling and processing were completed utilizing Polars, which provides the DataFrame capabilities of 
NumPy and Pandas with enhanced performance for large datasets~\cite{polars}.
